[ Martin Maas (maas@eecs.berkeley.edu): This version differs from the
original v2.1 release in the following aspects:
* Added library_spike.c for Spike support and modified interpreter.h
* Moved all files into the same directory and changed includes
* Added extern "C" to picoc.h to allow it to be used from C++
* Removed Makefile

picoc
-----

PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting. It was originally written 
as a script language for a UAV's on-board flight system. It's also very 
suitable for other robotic, embedded and non-embedded applications.

The core C source code is around 3500 lines of code. It's not intended to be 
a complete implementation of ISO C but it has all the essentials. When 
compiled it only takes a few k of code space and is also very sparing of 
data space. This means it can work well in small embedded devices. It's also 
a fun example of how to create a very small language implementation while 
still keeping the code readable.

picoc is now feature frozen. Since it's important that it remain small it's 
intended that no more major features will be added from now on. It's been 
tested on x86-32, x86-64, powerpc, arm, ultrasparc, HP-PA and blackfin 
processors and is easy to port to new targets. 


Compiling picoc
---------------

picoc can be compiled for a UNIX/Linux/POSIX host by typing "make".

The test suite can be run by typing "make test".


Porting picoc
-------------

platform.h is where you select your platform type and specify the includes 
etc. for your platform.

platform_XXX.c contains support functions so the compiler can work on 
your platform, such as how to write characters to the console etc..

platform_library.c contains your library of functions you want to make 
available to user programs.

There's also a clibrary.c which contains user library functions like 
printf() which are platform-independent.

Porting the system will involve setting up suitable includes and defines 
in platform.h, writing some I/O routines in platform_XXX.c, putting 
whatever user functions you want in platform_library.c and then changing 
the main program in picoc.c to whatever you need to do to get programs 
into the system.

platform.h is set to UNIX_HOST by default so tests can be easily run on
a UNIX system. You'll need to specify your own host setup dependent on 
your target platform.
