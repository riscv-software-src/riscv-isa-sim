Building embench tests for use with spike
-----------------------------------------

The embench tests can be obtained from this github repiository:
git clone https://github.com/embench/embench-iot.git

Only two additional files are required to build these tests for use with spike:
- a build script
- a crt0 source code file

The crt0-spike.c file needs to be put into the directory:
  config/riscv32/boards/ri5cyverilator/
within the embench-iot repository.

Note that the build script requires access to a 32-bit RISCV compiler. The embench_build.sh needs to be modified to be able
to locate this compiler.

The embench_build.sh needs to be put into the top level directory of embench-iot. This script will build all of the embench tests.
