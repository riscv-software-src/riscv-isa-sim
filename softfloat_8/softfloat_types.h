| Types used to pass 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit floating-point
| arguments and results to/from functions.  These types must be exactly
| 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and 128 bits in size, respectively.  Where a
| platform has "native" support for IEEE-Standard floating-point formats,
| the types below may, if desired, be defined as aliases for the native types
| (typically 'float' and 'double', and possibly 'long double').
